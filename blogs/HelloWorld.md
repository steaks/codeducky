Hello word!  <a href="/?author=3">Mike Adelson</a>, <a href="/?author=2">Ben Reich</a>, <a href="/?author=4">Dan Gallagher</a>, and I (<a href="/?author=1">Steven Wexler</a>) created this blog to share our thoughts about software development.  We will write about develompent practices, patterns, technologies, and opinions that peak our (and hopefully your) interest.

We all work on a web application for <a href="http://www.predictivetechnologies.com/">Applied Predictive Technologies</a> and tend to work mostly with C#, Javascript, and MS SQL.  We each also play around with Java, Scala, Python, and other languages/technologies.  So expect many of our posts to touch upon general development concepts with an emphasis on C# and web development.  However, don't be surprised when we venture out into different development territories.

We hope you find our posts entertaining, interesting, and thought provoking!  We view our posts as conversation starters, not standalone tutorials, so please continue the conversation by providing  feedback and counterpoints in our comments section!

Oh, I almost forgot to mention how we came up with our name.  It's a play on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging</a>.  Pretty simple, but we like it!
